MLOps Airflow Project
Overview
This project involves implementing an Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to automate the processes of data extraction, transformation, and storage. The tasks include web scraping, data preprocessing, and saving the data to a CSV file. Additionally, the project integrates version control using Git and Data Version Control (DVC) to track changes in the data.

Objectives
Implement an Apache Airflow DAG for data extraction, transformation, and storage.
Utilize web scraping techniques to extract data from specified URLs.
Preprocess extracted data to clean and format it for further analysis.
Store the preprocessed data in a CSV file.
Integrate version control using Git and DVC to track changes to the data.
Workflow
The workflow of the implemented Apache Airflow DAG is as follows:

Extract Task (extract_task):

Extracts data from the specified URLs using web scraping techniques.
URLs used:
https://www.dawn.com/
https://www.bbc.com/
Extracts links and article metadata (title, description) from the landing pages of the specified URLs.
Implements error handling to ensure robustness during data extraction.
Preprocess Task (preprocess_task):

Preprocesses the extracted data to clean and format it appropriately for further analysis.
Utilizes regular expressions and string manipulation techniques to remove HTML tags and non-alphanumeric characters.
Standardizes the text data to lowercase for consistency.
Save Task (save_task):

Saves the preprocessed data to a CSV file (extracted.csv).
DVC Push Task (dvc_push_task):

Integrates DVC to track versions of the data.
Automates the process of pushing changes to the Git repository.
Git Push Task (git_push_task):

Pushes changes to the Git repository for version control.
Challenges Encountered
Dependency Management:

Ensured all necessary Python libraries and dependencies were installed and compatible with Airflow.
Error Handling:

Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions during data extraction and processing.
Integration with Git and DVC:

Configured Git and DVC to work seamlessly within the Airflow environment and automated the process of pushing changes.
Observations
The use of Airflow provided a scalable and flexible framework for orchestrating the data pipeline, allowing for easy monitoring and management of tasks.
Integrating version control with Git and DVC enhanced the reproducibility and traceability of the data pipeline, facilitating collaboration and ensuring data integrity.
Conclusion
The implementation of the Apache Airflow DAG for data extraction, transformation, and storage was successful in automating the specified tasks. The workflow provided a structured approach to handle the complexities of data processing and management, while the integration with version control systems added transparency and accountability to the process.

Recommendations
Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of the DAG to ensure efficient execution.
Explore additional features and capabilities of Airflow for advanced workflow orchestration and scheduling.
Document the DAG workflow, dependencies, and configurations for future reference and maintenance.
